# Abstract
This is a news website that allows users to switch through collections of articles by
subject as well as filter through a selected subject's articles by search terms.

### Specs
This project was my first written with React and I was given four days to finish it.
It was also my first time using Jest and Enzyme to run a testing suite.

### How it works
The page always loads on local news but there are four other subjects a user can choose
by clicking on a button on the left of the screen. In the header there is also a search
bar and, as per the spec, a user can enter a search query and search for it within the
current news subject by either clicking the search button or pressing enter.
